      This request accepts an array of bookable area IDs, which you can retrieve using the Venues endpoint.

      A validation error will be returned if you attempt to assign area(s) to a booking which doesn't have a venue,

      *won't* return an error response if you attempt to assign an area which is already assigned to the booking.

      If you're looking to append assigned areas rather than replace, see [Appending assigned areas](#operation/AppendAssignedAreas).
