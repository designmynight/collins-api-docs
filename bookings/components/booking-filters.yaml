    Filter by the number of "actual" guests. An actual guest is one that has been checked into
    the booking on arrival. For no-shows, actual_guests will be zero.

    You can filter by a range of actual guests, eg `1-10` for any bookings with an `actual_guest`
    between 1 and 10. You can also pass through more than one ranges, for example, `1-4,10-15` will 
    bring back bookings between 1 to 4 *and* between 10 to 15.
  example: 1-10
