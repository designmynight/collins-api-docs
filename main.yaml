      The API is accessible through the domain `api.collinsbookings.com`, and all API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. All requests should be made over HTTPS.

      Requests to the playpen environment can be made using the domain `api-playpen.collinsbookings.com`. You'll need separate credentials to connect to playpen which your account manager will be able to provide you with.

  - name: Authorisation
    description: |
      You must provide your bearer token with every request that you make to the API. To do this, set an HTTP
      `Authorization` header on your request that consists of the prefix `Bearer` and the token.

      To obtain a bearer token, please speak to your account manager.

      ```shell
      $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234567890" https://api.collinsbookings.com/api/customers
      ```
  - name: Request format
    description: |
      Data may be sent to the server either through parameters appended to the URL, or as a JSON object included in the request body.

      Where JSON is used, you should also include a header specifying the content type as `application/json`.

      ```shell
      $ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{\"first_name\": \"Dan\"}' https://api.collinsbookings.com/api/customers/12345
      ```

  - name: Response format
    description: |
      API responses are in JSON format. When there are exceptions to this rule, the documentation for the endpoint will make this clear.
  - name: Rate limits
    description: |
      All requests to the API are rate limited based on your credentials. You should check the headers for the current
      status of any rate limits -

      Header Name | Description
      --- | ---
      `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour
      `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window
      `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets, in ISO 8601 format

      If you go over the rate limit, you will receive an error response with the status code `429`.
  - name: Pagination
    description: |
      Some API responses are paginated. If a response contains paginated data, this will be clearly marked in these docs.

        You should check the headers for details about the pagination:

        Header Name | Description
        --- | ---
        `X-Pagination-Page` | The page number for the current set of results
        `X-Pagination-Per-Page` | The total number of resources that will be returned per page
        `X-Pagination-Total-Pages` | The total number of pages
        `X-Pagination-Total-Results` | The total number of resources that the search query returned

        To specify the page you want to retrieve results for, you should use the `page` URL parameter.

        For example, if you made the following request:

        ```shell
        $ curl https://api.collinsbookings.com/api/customers?query=@designmynight.com
        ```

        and the following headers were sent back:

        ```
        X-Pagination-Page           1
        X-Pagination-Per-Page       30
        X-Pagination-Total-Pages    4
        X-Pagination-Total-Results  100
        ```

        The query returned 100 results, but each request will only show 30 at a time. To grab the next 30, you will need
        to make an additional request with the `page` URL parameter and increment this for the number of pages (`X-Pagination-Total-Pages`),
        like so:

        ```shell
        $ curl https://api.collinsbookings.com/api/customers?query=@designmynight.com&page=2
        $ curl https://api.collinsbookings.com/api/customers?query=@designmynight.com&page=3
        $ curl https://api.collinsbookings.com/api/customers?query=@designmynight.com&page=4
        ```
